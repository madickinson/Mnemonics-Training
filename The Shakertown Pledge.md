## The Shakertown Pledge

Recognizing that Earth and the fullness thereof is a gift from our gracious God, and that we are called to cherish, nurture, and provide loving stewardship for Earth's resources, and recognizing that life itself is a gift, and a call to responsibility, joy, and celebration, I make the following declarations:


1. I declare myself a world citizen. 
2. I commit myself to lead an ecologically sound life.  
3. I commit myself to lead a life of creative simplicity and to share my personal wealth with the world's poor.  
4. I commit myself to join with others in the reshaping of institutions in order to bring about a more just global society in which all people have full access to the needed resources for their physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual growth.  
5. I commit myself to occupational accountability, and so doing I will seek to avoid the creation of products which cause harm to others.  
6. I affirm the gift of my body and commit myself to its proper nourishment and physical wellbeing. 
7. I commit myself to examine continually my relations with others and to attempt to relate honestly, morally, and lovingly to those around me.  
8. I commit myself to personal renewal through prayer, meditation, and study.  
9. I commit myself to responsible participation in a community of faith.
