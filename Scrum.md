#SCRUM

##Three Pillars
1. Transparency
2. Inspection
3. Adaptation

##Five Values
1. Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every Sprint.  
2. Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.  
3. Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the Sprint Backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.  
4. Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.  
5. Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.
