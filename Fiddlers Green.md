#Fiddler's Green
##US Cavalry Regimental Poem

Halfway down the road to hell,  
In a shady meadow green,  
Are the souls of all dead troopers camped  
Near a good old-time canteen.  
And this eternal resting place  
Is known as Fiddler's Green.  

Marching past, straight through to hell,  
The infantry are seen,  
Accompanied by the Engineers,  
Artillery and Marine,  
For none but the shades of Cavalrymen  
Dismount at Fiddler's Green.  

Though some go curving down the trail  
To seek a warmer scene,  
No trooper ever gets to hell  
Ere he's emptied his canteen,  
And so rides back to drink again  
With friends at Fiddler's Green.  

And so when man and horse go down  
Beneath a saber keen,  
Or in a roaring charge or fierce melee  
You stop a bullet clean,  
And the hostiles come to get your scalp,  
Just empty your canteen,  
And put your pistol to your head  
And go to Fiddler's Green.   



Fiddler's Green appears in Frederick Marryat's novel The Dog Fiend; Or, Snarleyyow, published in 1856,[4] as lyrics to a sailors' song:  

At Fiddler’s Green, where seamen true  
When here they’ve done their duty  
The bowl of grog shall still renew  
And pledge to love and beauty.
